# Health-Monitoring-System
Patient monitoring is a crucial part of the health care system nowadays, either at hospitals or at home. By making use of IoT technology, it is possible to overcome the problems faced by physically unstable patients and poor people in consulting a doctor on a regular basis. The basic idea behind the project is, it implies that whether a person is at home, on a trip, or at his work place, he/she can stay connected with the doctors. Our project presents IoT Based Patient monitoring system, which consist of wearable sensors that collect information on different parameters affecting the health of patients.
